# IE-nomorescams (Group Project)
The project involves the creation of a comprehensive website dedicated to increasing awareness of scams among elderly Australians. This initiative aims to address the vulnerability of this demographic to online scams and enhance their digital security. The website incorporates various tools and features, including a 'Scam Detector' powered by machine learning algorithms, a 'URL Checker' to assess link safety, and an 'Email Leak Detector' to identify potential compromises in data breaches. The goal is to empower users with knowledge and tools to navigate the online landscape securely and promote a safer digital environment for the targeted community.
